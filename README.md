# SoftwareDevelopmentforT14
For a football academy called T14, an online system was developed so that current students and new ones could log in and register there. Regular tests, progress reports, new announcements, and information from the administrative staff may all be done and published online, along with a plethora of additional options including online fee payment and online purchases of football supplies.
